# Emotion-Recognition
This is a CNN based model trained to predict facial emotions in real-time.

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN) for facial emotion detection using Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained on grayscale images of faces to classify them into seven emotion categories: **Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, and Neutral.**

**Model Architecture**<br>
The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers, batch normalization, max pooling, and dropout layers. The model is designed to classify images into one of the seven emotion categories using the following layers:<br>

Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation<br>
Batch Normalization<br>
Max Pooling<br>
Dropout<br>
Dense Layers<br>
Softmax Activation for the output layer
